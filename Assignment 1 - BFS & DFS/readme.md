# 🔍 Graph Traversal Using BFS and DFS (C++)

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Develop a C++ program to perform **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** traversals on a graph. The program should:

- ✅ Accept user input for the number of vertices and edges.
- 🔗 Allow users to input edges of the graph.
- 🗂 Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
- 🔄 Use **BFS** with a queue to traverse the graph starting from node `0`.
- 📚 Use **DFS** with a stack (non-recursive) to traverse the graph starting from node `0`.
- 🖨 Display the order of nodes visited during both traversals.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The graph is considered **directed**. An edge from `u` to `v` does **not** imply an edge from `v` to `u`.

## 📘 Overview

Graph traversal is a fundamental operation in computer science, widely used in:

- 🌐 Search engines  
- 👥 Social networks  
- 🗺 Route planning

This project demonstrates how to implement BFS and DFS using standard data structures in C++.

- 🧱 `vector<int> adj[]` – Adjacency list
- 📬 `queue<int>` – For BFS
- 🧳 `stack<int>` – For DFS
- 🔍 `vector<bool> visit` – To track visited nodes

## 💻 Requirements

- 🧠 Basic understanding of graph algorithms
- ⚙️ C++11 or higher compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- 🖥 Optional: IDE such as Eclipse, Code::Blocks, or VS Code
